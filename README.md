Preface
----------
Howdy again.

I challenged myself to learn as much web-development as possible within a 24 hour time span. I started with Yeoman, and then went into a full MEAN solution stack. I also took this opportunity to learn Bootstrap, all the major intricacies of actually developing for production, nginx, Bower, Grunt, etc. Woo!

Running the Code
--------------
Simply run "grunt serve". This presumes you have npm and grunt set up, of course.
